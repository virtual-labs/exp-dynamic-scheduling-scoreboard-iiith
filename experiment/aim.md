### Aim of the Experiment

The aim of this experiment is to understand and analyze the mechanism of dynamic instruction scheduling using scoreboarding in pipelined processors. Students will observe how the scoreboard tracks the status of functional units, manages instruction dependencies, and enables out-of-order execution while preventing data and structural hazards. The experiment also aims to illustrate the performance benefits and limitations of scoreboarding as a scheduling technique.
